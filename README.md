# Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesperson Problem – Tabu Search

This repository contains an implementation of a **Tabu Search heuristic** for the **Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesperson Problem (FSTSP)**, developed as part of the *Optimization Algorithms* course project.

The algorithm coordinates a truck and a drone to serve a set of customers, aiming to minimize the total completion time while respecting endurance and synchronization constraints.

## 1. Execution instructions

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages:
- `matplotlib`

You can install the dependency with:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
How to run
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copiar código
cd "COURSE PROJECT"
Make sure the following directory structure is available:

nginx
Copiar código
COURSE PROJECT/
│
├── tabu_search.py
├── instances/
│   ├── FSTSP-40-1-1.txt
│   ├── FSTSP-40-1-2.txt
│   └── ...
└── results/
Run the heuristic:

bash
Copiar código
python tabu_search.py
During execution, each benchmark instance is solved using 3 independent Tabu Search runs, each one initialized with a different random seed.
This means that, for every dataset:

The algorithm explores different regions of the solution space.

Multiple feasible solutions are generated instead of a single one.

The best, average, and variability of the results can be analyzed.

The final reported results correspond to:

The best solution found among the 3 runs.

The average performance across the runs, used for comparison and evaluation.

The script will automatically:

Read all benchmark instances from the instances/ folder.

Execute 3 Tabu Search runs per instance.

Save plots and numerical results under the results/ directory.

Create an additional results/report/ folder containing the figures and the summary CSV table used in the report.

3. Algorithm overview
Solution representation
Solutions are encoded as permutations of customers. From each permutation, a base truck route is constructed and locally beneficial drone sorties are assigned using a greedy rule.

Initial solution
A nearest-neighbor heuristic based on truck travel times is used to generate the initial permutation.

Neighborhood
Neighbor solutions are generated by swapping two customers in the permutation.

Evaluation
Each solution is evaluated using a detailed truck–drone simulation that enforces endurance, synchronization, and service constraints.

Metaheuristic
A Tabu Search framework with a fixed tabu tenure and an aspiration criterion guides the exploration of the solution space.

4. Experimental evaluation
For each benchmark instance:

The heuristic is executed 3 independent times with different random seeds.

Performance metrics include:

Best and average objective value

Runtime

Number of neighbor evaluations (expansions)

Number of customers served by the truck and by the drone

Results are compared against Gurobi optimal solutions provided in the project statement.

All plots and the summary table used in the report are generated automatically by the code.

5. Notes
The total execution time respects the 10-minute limit imposed by the assignment.

All results reported in the accompanying PDF can be reproduced by running the script as described above.

The code is self-contained and does not require external solvers.

Si quieres, en el siguiente mensaje puedo:
- ajustar el texto exactamente a lo que **hace ahora el código** (por ejemplo, si cambias otra vez el número de runs), o  
- simplificar aún más la explicación para que sea **100% directa y sin redundancias** (muy estilo corrección).
