# Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesperson Problem – Tabu Search

This repository contains an implementation of a **Tabu Search heuristic** for the **Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesperson Problem (FSTSP)**, developed as part of the *Optimization Algorithms* FSTSP-Tabu-Search-main.

The algorithm coordinates a truck and a drone to serve a set of customers, aiming to minimize the total completion time while respecting endurance and synchronization constraints.

## 1. Execution instructions

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the dependency with:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

How to run
Navigate to the project directory:
````bash
cd "FSTSP-Tabu-Search-main"
````

Unzip the benchmark and results folders:
````nginx
unzip instances.zip
unzip results.zip
````

Make sure the following directory structure is available:

````nginx
FSTSP-Tabu-Search-main/
│
├── tabu_search.py
├── instances/
│   ├── FSTSP-40-1-1.txt
│   ├── FSTSP-40-1-2.txt
│   └── ...
└── results/
````

Run the heuristic:
````bash
python tabu_search.py
````

During execution, each benchmark instance is solved using 3 independent Tabu Search runs, each one initialized with a different random seed. This means that, for every dataset:
- The algorithm explores different regions of the solution space.
- Multiple feasible solutions are generated instead of a single one.
- The best, average, and variability of the results can be analyzed.
- The final reported results correspond to:
-The best solution found among the 5 runs.
-The average performance across the runs, used for comparison and evaluation.

The script will automatically:
1. Read all benchmark instances from the instances/ folder.
2. Execute 5 Tabu Search runs per instance.
3. Save plots and numerical results under the results/ directory.
4. Create an additional results/report/ folder containing the figures and the summary CSV table used in the report.

## 3. Algorithm overview
Solution representation -> Solutions are encoded as permutations of customers. From each permutation, a base truck route is constructed and locally beneficial drone sorties are assigned using a greedy rule.

Initial solution -> A nearest-neighbor heuristic based on truck travel times is used to generate the initial permutation.

Neighborhood -> Neighbor solutions are generated by swapping two customers in the permutation.

Evaluation -> Each solution is evaluated using a detailed truck–drone simulation that enforces endurance, synchronization, and service constraints.

Metaheuristic -> A Tabu Search framework with a fixed tabu tenure and an aspiration criterion guides the exploration of the solution space.

## 4. Experimental evaluation
For each benchmark instance:
  - The heuristic is executed 5 independent times with different random seeds.
  - Performance metrics include:
    - Best and average objective value
    - Runtime
    - Number of neighbor evaluations (expansions)
    - Number of customers served by the truck and by the drone
  - Results are compared against Gurobi optimal solutions provided in the project statement.
All plots and the summary table used in the report are generated automatically by the code.

## 5. Notes
The total execution time respects the 10-minute limit imposed by the assignment.
All results reported in the accompanying PDF can be reproduced by running the script as described above.
The code is self-contained and does not require external solvers.
